## RESTful web service for bus depot DB


Created a Spring boot Maven project with CRUD operations and
deployed it as a microservice on the cloud.


Our Micro Web Service allows the user to maintain a complete database for a public Bus
Depot. It provides operations such as insert, find, update, delete on the database. The user can
create an entry for a new bus added to the bus depot or he can update the details of an already
existing bus. He can search among the buses of the same manufacturer of which type like
private or public. Days on which buses are not functional is also available. Finally we can
delete a bus which is not functional from our database.
